# TopDownScroller

Basic top down scroller physics with pygame, will probably make a project using this later at some time. Pygame required, you can remove import os and the root_dir variable, as they don't have any use. It's pretty basic and should work, will probably add a seperate rect for display and the actual hitbox.
